# Image-Classification
# 
# This project is intended to track cells within a video using the SLEAP 
# toolbox (https://sleap.ai/#). The sleap toolbox uses deep-learning to 
# track the position of animals in a video and provides the position of the
# animals (as well as different parts of their body) on each frame of the 
# video. 
# 
# The current toolbox uses the information generated by SLEAP to find out 
# the position, head-direction, speed and direction of motion of each cell
# in the video.
#
# Missing: A tutorial to create .hd5 files from .avi files using sleap. The 
# .hd5 files is used for analysis using MATLAB.
